Hi:) I'm Irene Shang Li, a PhD applicant in Educational Psychology. I am currently advised by [Prof. James Stigler](https://www.psych.ucla.edu/faculty-page/stigler/), working as a Research Assistant at [UCLA Teaching and Learning Lab](https://uclatall.com). My research interest lies at the intersection of mathematics education and psychology.

I graduated from [Duke University](https://duke.edu) and [Duke Kunshan University](https://www.dukekunshan.edu.cn) in 2022, with a bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and Computational Sciences. Then in 2023, I received my master's degree in Education (Social Research Methodologies track) from [the School of Education & Information Studies](https://seis.ucla.edu), [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu). 

Happy to connect to talk about everything related to mathematics and mathematics education!
