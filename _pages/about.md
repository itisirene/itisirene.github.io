Hi there! I am Irene Shang Li, a PhD applicant in Educational Psychology. Currently under the guidance of [Prof. James Stigler](https://www.psych.ucla.edu/faculty-page/stigler/), I am serving as a Research Assistant at [the UCLA Teaching and Learning Lab](https://uclatall.com). My research is centered around the captivating intersection of mathematics, education, and psychology — I approach math education with a dual perspective, considering both the psychological aspects and mathematical knowledge. I am particularly interested in examining the cognitive learning process during K-9 mathematics education.

I earned my bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and Computational Sciences from [Duke University](https://duke.edu) and [Duke Kunshan University](https://www.dukekunshan.edu.cn) in 2022. Following that, in 2023, I obtained my master's degree in Education with a concentration in Social Research Methodologies from [the School of Education and Information Studies](https://seis.ucla.edu), [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu).

I am passionate about connecting with others to discuss all things related to mathematics and mathematics education. Feel free to reach out — I would love to engage in thoughtful conversations on these topics!
