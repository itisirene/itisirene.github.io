Hi! I am Irene Shang Li, a first-year doctoral student in Psychological Sciences at [Peabody College](https://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/), [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/). Advised by [Bethany Rittle-Johnson](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/psychological_sciences/bio/bethany-rittle-johnson) at [the Childern's Learning Lab](https://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/academics/departments/psych/research-labs/childrens-learning-lab/), I study how children's math cognition develops during educational interventions. I am currently the graduate student lead of an NSF project named "Leveraging Numerical Patterns in a Modified Board Game to Improve Numeracy Knowledge in Primary School Students".

I earned my bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics and Computational Sciences from [Duke University](https://duke.edu) and [Duke Kunshan University](https://www.dukekunshan.edu.cn) in 2022. Following that, I obtained my master's degree in Education with a concentration in Social Research Methodologies from [the School of Education and Information Studies](https://seis.ucla.edu), [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.ucla.edu). Then I worked with [James Stigler](https://www.psych.ucla.edu/faculty-page/stigler) at [the UCLA Teaching and Learning Lab](https://uclatall.com) before I attended Vanderbilt University.

I am passionate about all things related to mathematics and mathematics education. Feel free to reach out â€” I would love to engage in thoughtful conversations on these topics!
