Welcome to this page! Here I would like to share more about me outside of academia.

I used to work as a part-time content creator and backstage commercial producer before starting my PhD program. This job was more than just a way to earn moneyâ€”it gave me the opportunity to collaborate with brands that shared my values and aesthetic sensibilities, allowing me to express my ideas through video content.  

Although I no longer take on projects, I still enjoy capturing photos and videos. Life is always beautiful and worth documenting. I photograph landscapes, cultural moments, strangers, friends, and even myself.
