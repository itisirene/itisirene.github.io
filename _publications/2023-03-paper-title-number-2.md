This paper was written during my summer research internship at the Asian Centre for Mathematics Education (ACME). I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Lianghuo Fan](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5x7swf/emeritus-professor-lianghuo-fan) and [Dr. Shuhui Li](https://math.ecnu.edu.cn/~shli/intro_c.html?language=2&id=234) for providing comprehensive training in conducting a literature review. Special thanks also to research scholars worldwide for their generous assistance in gathering valuable information on calculator usage in their respective countries.
