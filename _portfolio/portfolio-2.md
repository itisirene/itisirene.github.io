At [the Tsinghua Child Cognition Center](https://www.tsinghuakidlab.com/en/), I worked with [Prof. Stella Christie](https://brain.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1010/1004.htm) and [Dr. Honghong Bai](https://brain.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1063/1242.htm) as a summer research assistant.

I participated in two research projects. The first one, titled "The Emergence of Creativity within and between Kids and its Educational Implications," explores the emergence of creativity in children during parental conversations. The second project involves a cross-ethnic study on language's effect on children's numerical cognition, conducted in collaboration with the Harvard Laboratory for Developmental Studies. In this capacity, I assisted in recruiting volunteer families through online and in-person advertising workshops, negotiated with kids and parents, conducted over 10 hours of research, participated in coding transcripts for over 50 hours, and drafted public reports.
