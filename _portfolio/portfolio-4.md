At [the Asian Centre for Mathematics Education](http://acme.ecnu.edu.cn/), I served as a summer research intern under the supervision of [Prof. Lianghuo Fan](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/people/5x7swf/emeritus-professor-lianghuo-fan) and [Dr. Shuhui Li](https://math.ecnu.edu.cn/~shli/intro_c.html?language=2&id=234). Our collaborative efforts resulted in a paper titled ["Should Calculators be Allowed to Use in College Entrance Examinations in Mathematics: An International Comparison of 30 Countries and Regions’ Calculator Use Policies and Practices in College Entrance Examinations"](https://itisirene.github.io/publications/2023-03-paper-title-number-2). Throughout this project, I gathered information from open archives, contacted scholars and students from over 10 countries to collect data about math college entrance exams, analyzed math curriculum and problems in exam sheets, drafted the paper, and contributed to the paper's revision. This work was published in the Journal of East China Normal University in March 2023.

I was also involved in organizing and volunteering at [the 14th International Congress on Mathematical Education](https://www.icme14.org/static/en/index.html?v=87534149056). As a junior college student, this experience unveiled the expansive realm of math education research, fostered my connections with global research scholars, and solidified my aspiration to become a math education researcher. Simultaneously, I was determined to become a presenter at ICME-15. The dream did come true—in July 2024, I will be presenting my paper titled ["Measures of Math Anxiety among School-Aged Students"](https://itisirene.github.io/publications/2024-07-paper-title-number-3) in Sydney.
