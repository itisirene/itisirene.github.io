In my role as an independent researcher, I collaborated with Senior Lecturer John Harper to investigate students' criteria for selecting instructors in the English for Academic Purposes (EAP) course. My contributions includes literature review, research design, volunteer recruitment, coordination of focus group interviews, analysis of survey and interview manuscripts, and collaborative paper writing. This collaborative effort has been published in the Journal of English Language Teaching and Linguistics.
