At [the UCLA Teaching and Learning Lab](https://uclatall.com/), I am fortunate to work full-time alongside [Prof. James Stigler](https://www.psych.ucla.edu/faculty-page/stigler/) as a research assistant.

My primary focus lies in leading a project that investigates college students' procrastination behaviors in introductory statistics. Specifically, I am examining the interplay between math anxiety (a psychological trait), academic procrastination (engagement data), and academic performance.  In this role, I initiate research questions, craft proposals, and conduct data coding and analysis using R Studio and Python on [CourseKata](https://coursekata.org/) data.

Additionally, I am actively engaged in a research topic centered on understanding high school students' motivation in introductory statistics classes. I contribute by conducting literature reviews and participating in statistical analyses to identify individual differences and between-group disparities in motivation factors, such as mindset beliefs, utility values, abilities, and self-efficacy. I pay particular attention to exploring these factors at the intersection of race and gender.
