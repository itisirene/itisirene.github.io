Joining [Prof. John Ji](https://nicholas.duke.edu/people/faculty/ji)'s lab during my freshman year has truly been a blessing. This experience introduced me to the realm of academia. I actively participated in a digital biomarker study focused on exploring the relationship between environmental pollution exposure and gene-environment interaction. In this role, I took on various responsibilities such as coordinating lab activities, conducting data collection from 8 air quality sensors on a weekly basis, utilizing R and Excel to identify changes in different air quality indexes, generating weekly air-quality reports, and designing promotional materials (including logos, posters, an official website, and souvenirs). Additionally, I played a key role in recruiting over 50 participants and facilitated research activities involving EEG and eye tracker technologies.
