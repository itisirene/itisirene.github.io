During my senior year at [Duke University](https://duke.edu/), I enrolled in [Dr. Kisha Daniels](https://scholars.duke.edu/person/kisha.daniels)' independent study class. Throughout the semester, I collaborated with Dr. Daniels to produce a video series aimed at raising awareness about eliminating Asian stereotypes and microaggressions. I conducted literature review research, carried out interviews, drafted the manuscript, filmed content, edited video clips using Final Cut Pro X, and published it on [my channel](https://space.bilibili.com/390202622?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0).
