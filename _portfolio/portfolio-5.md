My undergraduate signature work project, under the mentorship of [Prof. Konstantinos Efstathiou](https://www.efstathiou.gr/), focused on the theme of "Challenges and Opportunities in Technology Usage in K-12 Mathematics Education." The field study and interview segment were conducted at [South Lakes Elementary School](https://www.wcpss.net/southlakeses) in Cary, North Carolina, USA.
