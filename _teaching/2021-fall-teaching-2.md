I created tutorials on effective methods for completing various assignments, including editing videos, conducting literature reviews, and carrying out group assignments. I facilitated in-class discussions and promoted group collaboration to enhance engagement with coursework. Outside of class, I conducted office hours to provide guidance on assignments and support academic development (e.g. major choice, master and PhD application) for a group of 30 students.
